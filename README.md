# Mixed Reality applications for Mechanics of Materials Courses
This repository hosts a Mixed Reality (MR) application designed to enhance student learning and improve educational outcomes in Mechanics of Materials courses. The application was developed as part of a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA). Instructions for downloading and viewing the MR application can be found [here](./Instructions.md) (https://github.com/mrahman1987/MR_for_MoM/Instructions.md)

## Abstract
This project aimed to enhance student learning experience and outcomes in a university-level Mechanics of Materials (MoM) course by integrating mixed reality (MR) technology and engineering toolkits. MoM is a fundamental subject in engineering, covering critical concepts like stress analysis, material selection, and design optimization. However, students often struggle with abstract concepts such as forces, moments, and equilibrium, particularly those with weaker mathematical backgrounds. These challenges are exacerbated in large class settings where personalized attention is limited. To help students better understand these concepts, this project created an MR learning module and physical toolkits that allow them to visualize forces, moments, and equilibrium in 3D space. The study recruited 24 UTA undergraduate students to assess the impact of the mixed reality learning module and the physical toolkits. Participants were divided into three groups: one group learned a MoM topic using traditional instruction, one using MR, and one using physical toolkits. Participants' learning outcomes and experience were assessed using a knowledge quiz and a survey. Results showed that both MR and toolkit experience improved student learning outcomes compared to traditional classroom education. The findings of this research would improve student engagement, retention, and accessibility in MoM through immersive and interactive learning experience.
## Important Findings
Results showed that both MR and toolkit experience improved student learning outcomes (based on a Knowledge Quiz given after the three modes of instructions) compared to traditional classroom education. The aveage quiz scores for the three modes were 6.0 (SD = 2.51) for traditional instruction, 8.13 (SD = 1.46) for instruction with mixed reality, and 8.13 (SD = 1.55) for instruction with physical toolkits. However, the differences were not statistically significant.<br/>
